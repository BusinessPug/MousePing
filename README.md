A simple application made to be an improvement over the inbuilt windows "Mouse Sonar"

When the application is launched the user is met with a dialog form that displays a message about the Standard Hotkey,
and the option of not showing said message on subsequent openings of the program

The settings of the program can be found by going to your system tray (the little arrow on the right side of the Taskbar), right clicking on the mouse icon, and pressing "Settings"

Within the settings you have the option of setting a different HotKey, and also saving your preference for the next time the application is run

NOTE: the hotkey is absolute, meaning that the key you assign to the program cannot be used elsewhere, so "E" would be out of the question for most users
